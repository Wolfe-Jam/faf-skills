# FAF Skills

**Championship-Grade Claude Code Skills for `project.faf` Files**

---

## What is This?

**FAF Skills** helps you create and optimize `project.faf` files - **the AI equivalent of `package.json`**.

**What is `project.faf`?**
- A **file format** (like `package.json`, `README.md`, `tsconfig.json`)
- Contains your project info in **YAML** (AI's preferred language)
- Gets **scored 0-100%** for AI-readiness
- **IANA-registered** infrastructure (`application/vnd.faf+yaml`)
- Lives in your repository root (next to `package.json`)

**The better your `project.faf`, the better AI understands your project.**

Instead of remembering commands, just ask Claude in natural language and the right skill activates automatically.

**The Analogy:**
```
package.json = For npm to understand dependencies
tsconfig.json = For TypeScript to understand compilation
project.faf = For AI to understand your project
```

**The Vision:**
> One day (sooner the better), all repositories will have a `project.faf`.
>
> If it's missing, AI is not optimized.

**Example:**
- You: "Set up project context for this codebase"
- Claude: *Activates faf-init skill automatically*
- Result: `project.faf` created, scored 0-100%, ready to use

**Zero memorization. Automatic activation. Championship results.**

## The Core Skills

### 1. faf-teacher
**Foundational education before action.**

**When it activates:**
- "What is FAF?"
- "Explain The Reading Order"
- "Why do I need this?"
- "How does AI context work?"

**What it does:**
- Explains the 32-minute problem → <1 second solution
- Teaches The Reading Order (project.faf → CLAUDE.md → code)
- Shows verified ROI (73% reduction, 6,444% ROI)
- Corrects common misconceptions

**Result:** You understand WHY before WHAT.

---

### 2. faf-init
**Initialize project.faf files automatically.**

**When it activates:**
- "Set up project context"

- "Make this AI-ready"

**What it does:**
- Auto-detects project type (React, Next.js, Python, etc.)
- Generates valid project.faf in <50ms
- Uses IANA-registered format (application/vnd.faf+yaml)
- Calculates initial AI-readiness score

**Result:** Complete project DNA in seconds.

---

### 3. faf-score
**Measure AI-readiness (0-100%) with Podium scoring.**

**When it activates:**
- "What's my AI-readiness score?"
- "Check my FAF quality"

---

## Installation

### Quick Start (Copy Individual Skills)

**Copy any skill to your Claude Code skills directory:**

```bash
# Copy one skill
cp -r skills/faf-init ~/.config/claude-code/skills/

# Or copy all skills
cp -r skills/* ~/.config/claude-code/skills/
```

**Restart Claude Code and skills activate automatically.**

### Full Installation

**Clone the entire toolkit:**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Wolfe-Jam/faf-skills.git

# Run installation script
cd faf-skills
./install.sh
```

**This installs all 7 core skills at once.**

---

## How Skills Work

### Automatic Activation

Skills activate automatically when you ask questions in natural language:

**Example 1:**
```
You: "What's my AI-readiness score?"
Claude: [faf-score skill activates automatically]
Claude: Runs `faf score`, shows results, explains tier
```

**Example 2:**
```
You: "Improve my project context"
Claude: [faf-enhance skill activates automatically]
Claude: Analyzes gaps, asks questions, adds content, re-scores
```

**Example 3:**
```
You: "Sync project.faf and CLAUDE.md"
Claude: [faf-sync skill activates automatically]
Claude: Runs `faf bi-sync`, reports results (8ms)
```

### Token Efficiency

**Skills are token-efficient:**
- Idle: 30-50 tokens (just description)
- Active: Full instructions load only when needed
- 99%+ savings vs manual prompting

**Simon Willison (Oct 2025):**
> "Claude Skills are potentially more impactful than MCP because of their simplicity and efficiency."

---

## Prerequisites

**You need faf-cli installed:**

```bash
# via npm (works everywhere)
npm install -g faf-cli

# via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install wolfe-jam/faf/faf-cli

# Verify installation
faf --version  # Should show v3.1.1 or later
```

**Optional but recommended:**

```bash
# claude-faf-mcp (MCP server)
npm install -g claude-faf-mcp
```

---

## The Skill Workflow

**Typical session with FAF Agent Toolkit:**

```bash
# 1. Learn (first time)
You: "What is FAF?"
→ faf-teacher activates
→ Explains the 32-minute problem, The Reading Order, IANA registration

# 2. Initialize
You: "Set up project context"
→ faf-init activates
→ Creates project.faf, shows initial score (58% Silver)

# 3. Score
You: "What's my score?"
→ faf-score activates
→ Shows 58% (Silver tier), gaps identified

# 4. Enhance
You: "Improve my score"
→ faf-enhance activates
→ Adds testing docs (+6%), API docs (+4%), architecture (+2%)
→ New score: 70% (Gold tier) ✨

# 5. Sync
You: "Sync to CLAUDE.md"
→ faf-sync activates
→ Bidirectional sync in 8ms

# 6. Validate
You: "Is my format correct?"
→ faf-validate activates
→ 100% compliant with IANA spec

# 7. Share
You: "Ready to share!"
→ project.faf is validated, scored, synced, compliant
```

**Total time:** 15-30 minutes from zero to Gold tier.

---

## The Reading Order

**What FAF Skills help you create:**

```
1. project.faf   → Project DNA (architecture, stack)     [Skills: init, score, enhance]
2. CLAUDE.md     → Workflow instructions                [Skills: sync]
3. README.md     → User documentation
4. package.json  → Dependencies
5. Config files  → Build settings
6. Code          → Implementation
```

**Why this matters:**
- AI reads architecture BEFORE code
- Complete context in <1 second
- Zero questions, instant understanding
- 95%+ accuracy vs 60-70% from code alone

---

## Key Principles

### Format-Driven Architecture

**FAF is IANA-registered infrastructure:**
- **Media Type:** application/vnd.faf+yaml
- **Registration Date:** October 31, 2025
- **Authority:** Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
- **Recognition:** Same level as PDF, JSON, XML

**Not a tool. Foundational infrastructure.**

### Context Before Code

**Skills teach this philosophy:**
- Architecture BEFORE implementation
- Purpose BEFORE details
- Complete picture BEFORE diving in

**Result:** Better AI suggestions, fewer mistakes.

### Measurable Progress

**Podium scoring provides:**
- 0-100% quantifiable AI-readiness
- Clear tier system (Trophy/Gold/Silver/Bronze)
- Visible progress (58% → 70% → 89%)
- Actionable improvement paths

### NO BS ZONE

**All skills follow:**
- Only verified claims (IANA registration is real)
- Real metrics (73% reduction, Anthropic research)
- Honest limitations (it's free software)
- Professional, boring, trusted

## Success Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Project Setup

```
1. faf-init → Create project.faf (45% Bronze)
2. faf-enhance → Add details (70% Gold)
3. faf-sync → Mirror to CLAUDE.md
4. faf-validate → Confirm compliance
```

**Time:** 30-60 minutes
**Result:** Gold tier AI-readiness

### Pattern 2: Existing Project Upgrade

```
1. faf-teacher → Understand value
2. faf-init → Generate from codebase (58% Silver)
3. faf-score → See baseline
4. faf-enhance → Targeted improvements (72% Gold)
5. faf-sync → Integrate with workflow
```

**Time:** 1-2 hours
**Result:** Excellent AI context

### Pattern 3: Legacy Format Migration

```
1. faf-validate → Detect old format (v2.x)
2. faf-migrate → Upgrade to v3.0.0
3. faf-validate → Confirm IANA compliance
4. faf-score → Measure quality
5. faf-enhance → Improve if needed
```

**Time:** 10-20 minutes
**Result:** Modern, compliant format
