## Standards & Philosophy

### NO BS ZONE

**All contributions must follow:**
- Only verified claims (no marketing hype)
- Real examples (not hypothetical)
- Honest limitations (it's free software)
- Professional tone (boring is better than exciting)

**Forbidden:**
- Words like "guaranteed", "best ever", "revolutionary"
- Unverified statistics
- Exaggeration or hype
- False comparisons

### Format-Driven Architecture

**Skills should:**
- Focus on IANA-registered FAF format (`application/vnd.faf+yaml`)
- Teach The Reading Order (project.faf → CLAUDE.md → code)
- Support universal AI compatibility
- Call existing faf-cli commands (don't reinvent)

### Championship Standards

**Quality over quantity:**
- One excellent skill > five mediocre skills
- Comprehensive examples > brief descriptions
- Clear instructions > clever abstractions
- Tested workflows > untested ideas
